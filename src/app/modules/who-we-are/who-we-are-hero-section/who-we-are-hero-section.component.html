        <p>Tbilisi Holding Company has been importing food products to Georgia for over 30 years.
            After the collapse of the Soviet Union, both large and small-scale retail markets effectively ceased operations. With the retail industry in instability and lacking an established private sector, food products and the majority of other goods were being sold and bought in street markets. As the process of privatization gained momentum, the number of  small-scale markets as well as supermarkets was gradually growing. This  was a familiar process that other developed countries have undergone long ago, a process that eventually leads to larger, chain markets being formed and necessitating the demand for a robust distribution infrastructure.  <br> 
            Foreseeing how this trend would inevitably play out in Georgia, we became one of the first entrants in the distribution sector, with the first mover advantage allowing us to set up distribution points in some of the most logistically advantageous locations as well as gain access to prime product placement in retail markets. Due to the hard work, dedication and expertise of our employees and partners, our company has managed to become one of the most successful and robust distribution chains in all of Georgia. Starting from the forwarder or merchandiser, all the way up to the regional supervisor, every rung of the company chain is staffed with highly qualified, trained and organized employees. The company has branches in Tbilisi, the capital of the country, and in the three largest cities across different regions of Georgia (Batumi, Kutaisi, and Telavi). Additionally, we possess warehouse infrastructure for either dry or refrigerated (-25 C/+18 C) storage (over 4000m2) as well as up to 90 units of different types of transportation vehicles.
            
         <br> <br> Our extensive distribution network enables us to supply more than 5,000 retail and wholesale facilities, starting from small format stores and up to hypermarkets and cafe-restaurants. A vital factor in the success of THC is our consistent and unabated adherence to our company policy - Deliver the highest quality products and services to our customers and partners.  This coupled with a well-organized distribution network and effective marketing and merchandising campaigns endows our imported products with country-wide recognition and success. This is precisely why, despite the tough competition in the food products market, the majority of our products have been unwaveringly maintaining their leadership over the years and holding a minimum of  top 3 positions in their respective product category. The undeniable success of our company can be seen from a variety of business markers: the consistent and growing demand from our partners, the priority placement in retail sale locations, data from the National Statistics Office of Georgia, customer feedback and retention on social networks, and the plethora of awards and acknowledgement that our product and brands receive on a yearly basis, awards such as The Golden Brand, often referred to as the business Oscars of Georgia. <br><br>
        
            For example: in 2022, our 4 brands: Shinhofer, Anchor, Hayleys and Yamuna became the Golden Brand winners, and in 2023, Shinhofer, Anchor, Hayleys won again.</p>
